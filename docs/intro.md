# Welcome to Doulab AI

**Doulab AI** is an open knowledge initiative exploring how distributed, federated, and agentic artificial intelligence can empower the next generation of digital governance and public infrastructure.

This documentation site hosts our whitepapers, implementation blueprints, policy notes, and research insights on:

- Federated AI Architectures
- Agentic AI Systems
- Digital Sovereignty & Decentralized Governance
- Identity, Trust, and Human-in-the-Loop Design

---

## Purpose

We aim to contribute to a **global commons** of AI knowledge and practical frameworks designed for **governments, enterprises, and civil society** building interoperable, trustworthy, and sovereign AI ecosystems.

Our approach centers on:

- **Transparency** – All models and protocols proposed are auditable and modular.
- **Modularity** – Each component can be adopted independently or as part of a full stack.
- **Resilience** – Designed for multi-stakeholder environments and decentralized control.
- **Public Value** – We prioritize utility for public infrastructure and human rights.
