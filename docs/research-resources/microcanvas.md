The MicroCanvas Framework (MCF) is a modular toolkit that helps teams make innovation repeatable — from discovery to delivery — with small, traceable steps.

- Clear canvases for problem framing, value propositions, experiments, and delivery.
- Evidence-first: every step ties to testable assumptions and observable signals.
- Reusable: works across products, services, and policy contexts.

Getting started

- Start with a quick baseline (ClarityScan) to focus your first moves.
- Use the core canvases to frame the problem, define value, and plan experiments.
- Keep a decision log and connect gates to evidence so momentum compounds.
