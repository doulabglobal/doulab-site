## What is Innovation?

Innovation translates an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay. It involves the deliberate application of information, imagination, and initiative to derive greater or different values from resources and encompasses all processes by which new ideas are generated and converted into valuable products.

In business, innovation often results when ideas are applied to satisfy customers' needs and expectations further. Innovation differs from invention because invention happens when someone ideates or creates a product or service. Innovation occurs when the same product or service starts creating value for customers.

In other words, ideas are cheap; execution is everything. From a practical perspective, innovation involves combining different ideas into a reality that can change people's lives. Innovations may be products, services, technologies, processes, or business models.

These innovations can be radical, bringing about a fundamental change in how we do things, or incremental, improving or enhancing existing solutions.

### Dimensions of Innovation

Conversely, the "dimensions" of innovation describe the areas within an organization where innovation can occur.



- **Product Innovation**: Involves changes to the products or services offered by an organization. It is about what the organization sells, ranging from minor improvements to major overhauls. (Keeley, Pikkel, Quinn, & Walters, 2013)

- Process Innovation focuses on changes to how products or services are created and delivered. It can involve manufacturing processes, software systems, or service delivery logistics.

- **Business Model Innovation**: Business conduct changes often involve how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. Some examples of business model innovation include product changes, markets, processes, and relationships with customers and suppliers. *(Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010)*

- **Organizational innovation is implementing a new organizational method in a firm's business practices, workplace organization, or external relations. It aims to improve a company's performance or workplace satisfaction. (Oslo Manual 2018**: Guidelines for Collecting, Reporting and Using Data on Innovation, 4th Edition, The Measurement of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Activities, 2018)

- Service Innovation is the introduction of new or significantly improved services. It can be related to changes in how a service is provided, such as using the latest technologies, methods, or concepts to enhance customer experience . *(Bettencourt, 2010)*

### Origins of Innovation

The "Origins of Innovation" refer to the sources or catalysts that spark the creative process, leading to new and transformative ideas within organizations. Organizations must understand these origins to cultivate a proactive and responsive innovation culture. Innovations can emerge from various origins, offering unique pathways to transformative and incremental advancements.

These sources can be internal, from within the organization, or external, influenced by market dynamics, technological developments, customer feedback, or regulatory changes. By identifying and leveraging these origins, companies can strategically harness innovation to maintain competitiveness, adapt to changing environments, and fulfill emerging market needs effectively.

This approach supports sustained growth and empowers organizations to shape their future through deliberate and strategic innovation efforts.



- **Technology-Driven Innovation**: arises from technological advancements, using new or improved technologies to create products, enhance processes, or redefine business models. *(McQuivey, 2013)*

- Market-driven innovation is catalyzed by customer needs, market changes, or shifts in consumer behavior, focusing on direct interactions with customers to understand their demands. *(Kim & Mauborgne, 2005)*

- Regulatory-driven innovation happens when laws, regulations, or policies prompt regulatory-driven innovation, leading to compliance -driven changes or innovations that use legal changes as a measurable advantage in outcomes. (Harvard Business Review, 2009)

- **Societal-Driven Innovation**: emerges from social shifts, cultural changes, or a commitment to ethical standards, aiming to address societal challenges such as sustainability and social well-being. *(Wagner, 2012)*

- **Competitive-Driven Innovation**: is stimulated by the need to differentiate from competitors, enter new markets, or improve market position, driven by the competitive landscape. (Christensen, Anthony, & Roth, 2004)

### Innovation Lifecycle

The innovation lifecycle stages outlined in the MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2) have parallels in various other innovation models, although the terminology and emphasis might differ slightly. Several sources describe similar phases in the innovation process, often encapsulating the journey from idea generation to market implementation.

For instance, the innovation lifecycle generally starts with a Discovery *(Mitzkus, 2024)* phase, where you generate and explore ideas. This step aligns closely with what some sources describe as the ideation or initial concept phase, which focuses on understanding problems and developing innovative solutions.

In the next phase, Validation *(Joubert, 2017)* , teams test and validate the feasibility of these ideas, similar to what other models might refer to as development or proof of concept, where they build prototypes and gather initial user feedback.

Efficiency *(Joubert, 2017)*, as described in the MCF 2.2, focuses on refining the process and making the solution cost-effective, similar to optimizing production and operational processes in other frameworks. Scaling *(Mitzkus, 2024)* , which involves broad market integration and expansion, is a critical phase many models identify as crucial for adopting innovation.

Finally, the Continuous *(Mitzkus, 2024)* phase in MCF 2.2, which emphasizes ongoing improvement and adaptation, mirrors what some innovation models call continuous or iterative refinement cycles based on market feedback and technological advancements. These phases (Startup Genome, 2011) are universally recognized across different innovation models, although the specific terms and some focal points might vary.

They serve as a comprehensive guide to navigating the complex process of bringing new ideas to fruition and ensuring they are sustainable and effective in the market.

## Innovation Frameworks

Innovation frameworks (Donovan & Grace) are structured tools and methodologies that guide organizations through the complex innovation process, from ideation to implementation. They serve as blueprints that help companies systematically manage their innovation activities, ensuring that ideas are generated and selected effectively, successfully executed, and integrated into the company's fabric.

These frameworks vary widely, but they typically share common objectives: to streamline the innovation process, reduce risks associated with innovation, and enhance the ability to achieve sustainable measurable advantage in outcomess. By providing clear guidelines and stages, innovation frameworks help organizations navigate the often chaotic process of transforming creative ideas into practical and marketable innovations.

Understanding and applying the proper innovation framework can significantly impact an organization's ability to innovate effectively. Any organization must strengthen its innovation capability and support alignment of its innovation efforts with its strategic goals to explore various innovation frameworks.

### Why Are They Important?

**Innovation frameworks are vital to business strategy for several key reasons**:

- **Structured Creativity**: They provide a structured approach to creativity and innovation, which helps organizations systematically generate, develop, and implement ideas. This structure reduces the randomness and chaos often associated with innovation, making the process more predictable and manageable.

- **Risk Management**: Innovation inherently involves risk. Frameworks help manage these risks by providing methodologies for testing and validating ideas at early stages, minimizing potential losses, and focusing resources on the most promising initiatives.

- **Speed to Market**: By streamlining the innovation process, frameworks can accelerate the development and commercialization of new products and services. This rapid execution is crucial in today's fast-paced markets, where being first can be a significant advantage.

- **Alignment with Strategy**: Innovation frameworks align new ideas with the organization's overall strategy. This alignment helps keep innovation efforts contributing to the broader business objectives, thus enhancing coherence and focus.

- **Sustainability of Innovations**: Frameworks facilitate not just the creation but also the implementation and scaling of innovations, ensuring they are not just creative flashes in the pan but sustainable changes that deliver ongoing value.

- **Measurement and Improvement**: They provide tools for measuring the effectiveness of innovation activities, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about where to invest in innovation. This continuous improvement loop is essential for long-term innovation success.

- Innovation frameworks are not just tools for creating new products or services; they are integral to fostering a culture of innovation within organizations, ensuring that innovation is continuous and aligned with organizational goals. This strategic alignment is essential for maintaining measurable advantage in outcomes and achieving sustainable growth.

### Types of Innovation Frameworks

Innovation frameworks vary widely, each designed to address specific aspects of the innovation process or to fit particular industry needs. Understanding the different types of innovation frameworks can help organizations select the one that best aligns with their strategic goals and operational style. One common type is the Stage-Gate Process *(Cooper, 2001)*, developed by Dr.

Robert Cooper. This framework is widely used in product development and divides the innovation process into distinct stages separated by decision points (gates), evaluating ideas before moving to the next phase. It's particularly valued for its systematic approach to managing the progression of new products from concept to launch, helping firms minimize risks and allocate resources effectively.

Another influential framework is the Lean Startup *(Ries, 2011)* methodology, pioneered by Eric Ries. It emphasizes rapid prototyping, validated learning, and other iterative design techniques to efficiently develop products that meet consumer needs without requiring large amounts of initial funding or resources. This approach is beneficial in dynamic markets or startups needing to adapt quickly.

Design Thinking *(Brown, 2009)* is a popular framework focusing on user experience and creative problem-solving. It involves a cyclical process of understanding the user, challenging assumptions, redefining problems, and creating innovative solutions through ideation, prototyping, and testing. This framework is beneficial for developing solutions that are not only technologically feasible but also viable in the market and desirable to users.

Each framework offers distinct advantages, and organizations can implement them in various combinations depending on their needs, industry requirements, and innovation objectives. Companies may choose a single approach or integrate elements from different frameworks to create a tailored innovation strategy that maximizes their innovative potential and aligns with their overall business strategy.

### Shortcomings of Existing Frameworks

While existing innovation frameworks provide structured methodologies for managing innovation processes, they also exhibit certain limitations that can hinder their effectiveness in various contexts. One common shortcoming is their often rigid structure, which can stifle creativity and spontaneity crucial for breakthrough innovations.

For instance, while managing risk and resource allocation effectively, the Stage-Gate Process might slow down the innovation process due to its many checkpoints and approvals, potentially causing companies to miss out on first-mover advantages in fast-evolving markets.

Furthermore, frameworks like the Lean Startup methodology, which emphasize speed and agility through iterative cycles, may fragment the approach and cause the loss of the bigger strategic picture amidst rapid pivoting and minimally viable products (MVPs). Using Lean Startup in this way can sometimes result in products that solve immediate user problems but fail to align with long-term business objectives or scale effectively in the market.

Additionally, while Design Thinking fosters empathy and creativity, integrating existing business processes can be more complex, especially in more traditional or hierarchical organizations. The non-linear nature of Design Thinking can conflict with established processes that prioritize efficiency and predictability, leading to challenges in implementing and scaling innovative solutions.

These limitations highlight the importance of selecting or adapting innovation frameworks that address specific business needs and are flexible enough to evolve with changing market conditions and organizational dynamics. Adapting frameworks to fit an organization's unique Context, rather than adopting them wholesale, can help mitigate these shortcomings and enhance the overall effectiveness of the innovation process.

Sources like "The Innovator's Dilemma" (Christensen C. M., 1997) and articles from Harvard Business Review frequently discuss these issues, providing deeper insights into the practical challenges of applying innovation frameworks in real-world settings.

 **Enhanced Public Engagement and Innovation Literacy**: Future trends also suggest an increased focus on enhancing public engagement and innovation literacy.

By involving citizens and end -users early in the innovation process, labs can support their developments are closely aligned with user needs and societal values. Moreover, educating the public about the benefits and processes of innovation can enhance support for innovation initiatives, leading to a more informed and supportive societal environment.

An example is innovation labs hosting public workshops and open days to demystify the innovation process and gather public input. *(Lane, 1999)* Embracing these trends and opportunities, National Innovation Lab Networks can enhance their capabilities and contribute more effectively to global and societal progress.

These developments promise to transform the landscape of national and international innovation, driving forward a future where collaborative, intelligent, and sustainable innovation practices are at the forefront.

## Innovation Labs in a World of Uncertainty: Strategic Foresight and Vigía Futura

Innovation labs without foresight become reactive, responding to external shocks instead of shaping opportunity spaces. Trend monitoring is useful for tracking surface signals, but strategic foresight reframes uncertainty into actionable choices.

[*Vigía Futura*](https://doulab.net/vigia-futura) is a regional observatory that produces signals, scenarios, and indices to inform innovation priorities. Foresight feeds labs; labs test futures. This interaction turns uncertainty into a continuous learning loop across strategy, experimentation, and scale.

The following diagram shows the closed loop between foresight inputs, experimentation, and strategy updates.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, National Innovation Lab Networks embody a transformative approach to fostering widespread innovation across diverse geographic and sectoral landscapes. By leveraging the collective strength and expertise of various local and regional labs, these networks significantly enhance a nation's ability to innovate, adapt, and thrive in an increasingly competitive global environment.

Establishing and effectively operating these networks requires careful attention to structure, governance, and collaboration, ensuring that every component functions synergistically to achieve broad national goals. Securing sustainable funding, ensuring effective communication, and maintaining alignment are substantial challenges that, when encountered, can be managed with strategic planning and execution.

The integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, the emphasis on sustainable development, and the expansion of global collaborations represent key opportunities for these networks. These elements will drive the efficiency and output of innovation labs and support that their contributions are impactful and aligned with global needs and priorities.

Moreover, as public engagement and innovation literacy continue to grow, there is a tremendous opportunity to democratize innovation further, making it more inclusive and aligned with the needs and values of society at large. By focusing on these areas, National Innovation Lab Networks can continue to evolve and play a crucial role in shaping a resilient and prosperous future.

This guide has explored the multifaceted aspects of establishing, running, and scaling National Innovation Lab Networks, providing a roadmap for nations seeking to capitalize on collective intelligence and creativity. The system-level view that connects MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2), IMM, VILF, and Vigía Futura emphasizes adaptability, institutional learning, and decision integrity under uncertainty. It is a call to action for policymakers, industry leaders, and academics to invest in and nurture these networks while keeping their innovation systems responsive rather than final.

### Introduction to the MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2) and the structure of innovation projects using Micro Sprints

MCF 2.2-Tools-Core v2.0 - EN Luis Santiago (luis@lsantiago.net) April 10, 2024

### The motivation behind an innovation framework

The MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2) is the culmination of a six-year research, beginning in 2018, at NASA Ames Campus, in Mountain View, California. During this time, as an Entrepreneur in Residence for Singularity University's ( https://su.org) Graduate Studies Program, I was pondering how to accelerate innovation and transformation in organizations based outside the United States mecca of innovation, Silicon Valley.

As a software developer from the Dominican Republic myself, I'm no stranger to survival entrepreneurship and how the "stress response" as a survival mechanism can lead you to poor decisions during your entrepreneurship journey. *(LeFave, 2023)*. At the time, the question of "How can I guide my customers to "accelerated innovation" with a "recipe" that works across cultural contexts and economic realities, globally?

It dawned on me that most innovation frameworks only cover part of the innovation lifecycle and that, for most people, the knowledge required to properly manage innovation at an accelerated pace was still out of reach. Thus, a new "meta framework", one that would logically connect aspects or "micro-processes" of the full innovation lifecycle was needed. This was the moment when the "MicroCanvas" Framework was born.

### External disruptions are affecting all industries and all types of organizations.

According to a 2018 McKinsey report " The industrial sectors will see more disruption within the next five years than in the past 20 years combined " *(McKinsey & Company, 2018)*. These disruptions will only accelerate as the " the 21st century will be equivalent to 20,000 years of progress at today's rate of progress " *(Kurzweil & Meyer, 2003)* .

This means that tremendous amounts of stress are already straining most organizations' ability to understand and apply meaningful measures to tackle challenges produced by rapidly changing market conditions.

### Developing innovation in an accelerated and constant way is not easy.

Most organizations fail at maintaining a fast and constant pace of innovation development. Sometimes it feels like innovation is an art, more than a science. During the first stages of our exploration of innovation frameworks we realized that innovating, more than an art, is a meticulous process, that can be quantified and measured and that can not only be learned but that most organizations can implement.

Although we doubt creating new products and services will ever be "easy", failure rates tend to diminish greatly when "uncertainty" is reduced by having a structured innovation process. How can we then, adapt our organizations to these accelerated changes? Initiating a transformation process towards an accelerated organization completely focused on a transformative purpose.

According to a team at PA Consulting, the "secret sauce" of " Developing life -changing technology at pace is an artform " and it's " and its list of magic ingredients begins with defining your purpose" (Wired Insider).

At Doulab, we realized that to master the art of developing a transformative purpose, we needed to master the art of understanding our customers, their pains, needs and goals, and, more importantly, profoundly understanding the root cause of the problem we wanted to solve for them and what causes and effects were producing said problem.

That's why the MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2) core value proposition was dividing the innovation lifecycle into short "Micro Sprints", small experiments designed to help the organization reduce risk and volatility by implementing continuous agile innovation.

These micro sprints would shorten innovation cycles and allow for obtaining problem/solution fit during the "Discovery" phase of innovation projects, as well as Product/Market fit, during the "Validation" phase, much faster, thus accelerating each of these phases and reducing the cost and volatility associated with faster innovation cycles. More importantly, by building each micro sprint in a modular fashion, a linear path was not needed.

As long as the previous steps of the innovation process had well-defined outputs (for example, a well-defined understanding of the problem), there was no reason why an organization would have to follow the "innovation recipe" from the start, but rather start with a module in a later process.

Additionally, the MicroCanvas Framework (MCF 2.2) was designed to accommodate each phase of the innovation lifecycle and each of the "Contexts", a logical sub-division of the framework, designed to organize each of the micro-processes depending on what part aspect of the organization was designed to work for, was also logically connected through the whole innovation process.

### The Life cycle of innovation and entrepreneurship development.

We decided to adopt the "standard model" of innovation and entrepreneurship development that divides the innovation process in the following stages:

- **Discovery**: It involves identifying unmet market needs, generating innovative ideas and exploring potential solutions. It is a critical phase in which entrepreneurs and organizations evaluate the viability of their concepts through research and analysis before moving to more concrete stages such as validation, efficiency optimization and scalability.

- **MCF 2.2 processes associated with this stage**: Customer Analysis, Problem Analysis, Objectives and Key Results, Solution Alternative Analysis, Unique Advantages and Product Features , Transformative Purpose, Team Structure and Business Model Validation.

- **Validation**: It involves approving and confirming that a product, service or business model meets the identified needs of the market and has the potential for success. This often includes conducting experiments, collecting feedback from potential customers, and refining the offering based on that feedback to support it aligns with customer demands and preferences.

- **MCF 2.2 processes associated with this stage**: Key Growth Metrics, Key Impact Metrics, Sales, Marketing and Engagement, User Stories, Customer Experience and Loyalty and Business Model Validation.

- **Efficiency**: It involves evaluating and improving operations, workflows, and product features to support they are delivered with minimal resources while maintaining or improving customer value. It is about making the delivery of the product or service as efficient and simple as possible, ensuring that the company can grow and scale sustainably.

- **MCF 2.2 processes associated with this stage**: Cost and Revenue Structure, Risks, Operations, Financial Analysis, Legal Compliance and Strategy, External Stakeholders, Regulatory Constraints, External System Integrations, Product Architecture and Business Model Validation.

- **Scalability**: It involves optimizing and improving processes, infrastructure and systems to support growth, increase the ability to deliver products or services to a larger market segment and support that the business model can sustain increased sales and operations efficiently.

- **MCF 2.2 processes associated with this stage**: Future Disruptions, Accelerated Growth Attributes, Key Partners, Delivery Channels, Socio-cultural Context and Business Model Validation.

- **Continuous**: it involves continuously analyzing each aspect of the business model to continuously adapt by experimenting, monitoring, learning and improving.

- **MCF 2.2 processes associated with this stage**: Customer Analysis, Key Impact Metrics, Key Growth Metrics, Cost and Revenue Structure, Risks, Future Disruptions and Business Model Validation.

### Conclusion

The journey to develop MCF 2.2 2.0 has been incredibly interesting.

After more than 250 micro sprints with customers ranging from the financial and educational sectors, health, technology and others, coming from countries in the US, Europe and Latin America, with some notable failed experiments but many more successes, we have been able to distill and refine an innovation process that can help not only with innovation projects but also with organizational transformation.

As we move forward, MCF 2.2 will be improved and new tools built with new technologies, like artificial intelligence, will be incorporated to accelerate innovation development even further. Perhaps in a few years, your next coach will be completely artificial, and your innovation journey will move exponentially faster.
