Most teams begin with **[ClarityScan\xae](/services/clarityscan)** (15\u201320 minutes; get a baseline this week).\\n\\n**Custom workshops** create alignment, prioritization, and a 30\u201360\u201390 plan in one focused day. See **[workshop options](/services/custom-workshops)**.\\n\\n**Programs (IMM-P)** install operating rhythms, governance, and instrumentation so outcomes become reliable. Explore the **[IMM Program](/services/innovation-maturity)**.\\n\\n**Coaching & mentoring** unblock high-stakes priorities for execs, product, and GTM leaders. Learn more about **[coaching & mentoring](/services/coaching-mentoring)**.\\n\\n**Vig\xeda Futura** is our foresight observatory\u2014signals, executive briefings, and short policy/venture labs\u2014so leaders can act before the curve. Visit **[Vig\xeda Futura](/vigia-futura)**.\\n\\n## Why this matters now\\n\\nAI acceleration, shifting governance, and unsettled markets reward **learning velocity**. Teams that instrument decisions, run small bets, and iterate intentionally out-ship the rest. That\u2019s the system we help you install\u2014so you avoid the high cost of waiting and the regret of missed windows.\\n\\n## What\u2019s coming next\\n\\nWe\u2019re publishing **[Distributed Federated Agentic AI](/docs/research-resources/distributed-federated-agentic-ai)** (open access). We\u2019re rolling out **Vig\xeda Futura**\u2014a live radar (quarterly), executive briefings, and quick-turn policy/venture labs. And we\u2019re expanding the **MCF toolkit** and open resources for teams and public institutions\u2014see **[Research & Resources](/docs/research-resources)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n**Is this \u201cconsulting\u201d?**  \\nIt\u2019s **system installation**: decision scaffolds, operating cadences, and capability building. We co-create, transfer, and instrument so your team can run it.\\n\\n**How fast will we see value?**  \\nMost teams get a baseline and targeted actions within **a week** via ClarityScan\xae and/or a one-day workshop.\\n\\n**Do you work beyond the private sector?**  \\nYes. We\u2019ve adapted MCF + IMM for public contexts (e.g., **RedLab**) where governance and inclusion matter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Start here\\n\\nPrefer proof before plans? **[Get your baseline with ClarityScan\xae](/services/clarityscan)** and see exactly where to focus.  \\nPrefer a conversation? **[Book a discovery call](/contact)** and we\u2019ll map goals, constraints, and a fit-for-purpose path.\\n\\n<div className=\\"btn-row\\" style={{marginTop: \'0.5rem\'}}>\\n  <a className=\\"btn-primary\\" href=\\"/services/clarityscan\\" aria-label=\\"Get your baseline with ClarityScan\\">Get your baseline</a>\\n  <a className=\\"btn-secondary\\" href=\\"/contact\\" aria-label=\\"Talk to Doulab\\">Talk to us</a>\\n</div>"}]}}')}}]);
