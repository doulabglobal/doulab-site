In practice, that means making innovation **repeatable** and foresight **practical**—so plans become outcomes you can measure.\\n\\n**Default next step:** get a baseline in **15–20 minutes** with **[ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)**, or **[book a short discovery call](/contact)**.\\n\\n<!-- truncate -->\\n\\n## What gets in the way (the problem)\\n\\nAcross startups and institutions, the blockers rhyme.

Most teams begin with **[ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)** (15–20 minutes; get a baseline this week).\\n\\n**Custom workshops** create alignment, prioritization, and a 30–60–90 plan in one focused day. See **[workshop options](/services/custom-workshops)**.\\n\\n**Programs (IMM-P)** install operating rhythms, governance, and instrumentation so outcomes become reliable. Explore the **[IMM Program](/services/innovation-maturity)**.\\n\\n**Coaching & mentoring** unblock high-stakes priorities for execs, product, and GTM leaders. Learn more about **[coaching & mentoring](/services/coaching-mentoring)**.\\n\\n**Vigía Futura** is our foresight observatory—signals, executive briefings, and short policy/venture labs—so leaders can act before the curve. Visit **[Vigía Futura](/vigia-futura)**.\\n\\n## Why this matters now\\n\\nAI acceleration, shifting governance, and unsettled markets reward **learning velocity**. Teams that instrument decisions, run small bets, and iterate intentionally out-ship the rest. That’s the system we help you install—so you avoid the high cost of waiting and the regret of missed windows.\\n\\n## What’s coming next\\n\\nWe’re publishing **[Distributed Federated Agentic AI](/docs/research-resources/distributed-federated-agentic-ai)** (open access). We’re rolling out **Vigía Futura**—a live radar (quarterly), executive briefings, and quick-turn policy/venture labs. And we’re expanding the **MCF toolkit** and open resources for teams and public institutions—see **[Research & Resources](/docs/research-resources)**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n**Is this “consulting”?**  \\nIt’s **system installation**: decision scaffolds, operating cadences, and capability building. We co-create, transfer, and instrument so your team can run it.\\n\\n**How fast will we see value?**  \\nMost teams get a baseline and targeted actions within **a week** via ClarityScan® and/or a one-day workshop.\\n\\n**Do you work beyond the private sector?**  \\nYes. We’ve adapted MCF + IMM for public contexts (e.g., **RedLab**) where governance and inclusion matter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Start here\\n\\nPrefer proof before plans? **[Get your baseline with ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)** and see exactly where to focus.  \\nPrefer a conversation? **[Book a discovery call](/contact)** and we’ll map goals, constraints, and a fit-for-purpose path.\\n\\n<div className=\\"btn-row\\" style={{marginTop: \'0.5rem\'}}>\\n  <a className=\\"btn-primary\\" href=\\"/services/clarityscan\\" aria-label=\\"Get your baseline with ClarityScan\\">Get your baseline</a>\\n  <a className=\\"btn-secondary\\" href=\\"/contact\\" aria-label=\\"Talk to Doulab\\">Talk to us</a>\\n</div>"}]}}');
