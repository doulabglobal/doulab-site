Innovation shouldn’t be a coin flip.

We started **Doulab** to answer a stubborn question: *How do you make innovation and foresight repeatable—so strategy turns into measurable outcomes in any organization, not just the lucky ones?* Since then, we’ve supported teams across public institutions and companies—from **AFP Siembra** and **Alpha Inversiones** to **OGTIC/RedLab**, **FUNDAPEC**, and **Runway Innovation Hub**—and saw the same pattern: when teams can see clearly, decide faster, and learn in tight loops, they ship.

Our purpose is simple: **help unlock global prosperity by helping others create better futures**. In practice, that means making innovation **repeatable** and foresight **practical**—so plans become outcomes you can measure.

**Default next step:** get a baseline in **15–20 minutes** with **[ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)**, or **[book a short discovery call](/contact)**.

## What gets in the way (the problem)

Across startups and institutions, the blockers rhyme. Here are the most common ones we see—each solvable with the right scaffolding:

## The simple system under the work

We built two pieces that make the work feel less like guesswork:

- The **MicroCanvas® Framework (MCF)**, a set of lightweight canvases that move teams from discovery to delivery—without weeks of meetings.  
- The **Innovation Maturity Model (IMM®)**, a structured way to baseline capability, prioritize gaps, and install practice across strategy, culture, process, and results.

Used together, MCF + IMM reduce **decision latency** (fewer stalls), shorten **cycle time** (smaller bets, faster feedback), improve **signal quality** (evidence in planning & delivery), and raise **capability** (measurable progress across IMM dimensions).

> With **AFP Siembra**, strategy-to-delivery support led to a digital savings product and a working innovation lab—practical scaffolding for repeatable outcomes. External site: <a href="https://afpsiembra.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">afpsiembra.com</a>.

## What we install (the solution)

You don’t need a moonshot to get moving. We right-size entry points and build from there:

## Who we’re for

If you’re a founder or product leader pushing for clarity and speed; an executive team aligning strategy, governance, and operating rhythms; a public-sector leader building repeatable capacity; or a strategy/ops team hungry for better evidence loops—you’ll feel at home here.

## How we work together

We start where you are and build momentum:

**Diagnostics** give you a quick baseline and targeted actions. Most teams begin with **[ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)** (15–20 minutes; get a baseline this week).

**Custom workshops** create alignment, prioritization, and a 30–60–90 plan in one focused day. See **[workshop options](/services/custom-workshops)**.

**Programs (IMM-P)** install operating rhythms, governance, and instrumentation so outcomes become reliable. Explore the **[IMM Program](/services/innovation-maturity)**.

**Coaching & mentoring** unblock high-stakes priorities for execs, product, and GTM leaders. Learn more about **[coaching & mentoring](/services/coaching-mentoring)**.

**Vigía Futura** is our foresight observatory—signals, executive briefings, and short policy/venture labs—so leaders can act before the curve. Visit **[Vigía Futura](/vigia-futura)**.

## Why this matters now

AI acceleration, shifting governance, and unsettled markets reward **learning velocity**. Teams that instrument decisions, run small bets, and iterate intentionally out-ship the rest. That’s the system we help you install—so you avoid the high cost of waiting and the regret of missed windows.

## What’s coming next

We’re publishing **[Distributed Federated Agentic AI](/docs/research-resources/distributed-federated-agentic-ai)** (open access). We’re rolling out **Vigía Futura**—a live radar (quarterly), executive briefings, and quick-turn policy/venture labs. And we’re expanding the **MCF toolkit** and open resources for teams and public institutions—see **[Research & Resources](/docs/research-resources)**.

## FAQ

**Is this “consulting”?**  
It’s **system installation**: decision scaffolds, operating cadences, and capability building. We co-create, transfer, and instrument so your team can run it.

**How fast will we see value?**  
Most teams get a baseline and targeted actions within **a week** via ClarityScan® and/or a one-day workshop.

**Do you work beyond the private sector?**  
Yes. We’ve adapted MCF + IMM for public contexts (e.g., **RedLab**) where governance and inclusion matter.
