Decision latency is expensive. Every week a decision slips, costs creep, risk accumulates, and teams lose momentum. ClarityScan® gives you a **15–20 minute** baseline that pinpoints where latency comes from and what to change first—so you can move now, not next quarter.

## What is ClarityScan®?

- A fast, structured diagnostic across strategy, culture, operating model, and evidence loops.
- Built on the [MicroCanvas® Framework](https://themicrocanvas.com) (MCF) and the [Innovation Maturity Model Program (IMM‑P®)](/services/innovation-maturity) gates.
- Designed to produce **actionable next steps**—not a long report.

## Why we built it (20 years of patterns)

Over two decades working on innovation, one truth keeps showing up: most teams were never taught to think logically about innovation or structure projects in a way that makes decisions easy.

Across startups and established organizations building new technologies, business models, or simply improving commercial offerings, the same pattern appeared: **there was no clarity**. Teams struggled to pinpoint a target customer with precision, articulate the core problem, or outline a credible path to fix it.

The [MicroCanvas® Framework](https://themicrocanvas.com) (MCF) was born from that reality—repeatable canvases that create shared clarity. The [Innovation Maturity Model Program (IMM‑P®)](/services/innovation-maturity) later complemented MCF with a **12+12 weeks** structure to install cadence and governance so innovation becomes sustainable and friction drops.

There was still one missing piece: how to start on the right foot—quickly understanding today’s challenges and turning them into a steady, structured path forward.

That is why we built ClarityScan®. It is our guided onboarding step into the Doulab ecosystem. In minutes, we identify where your innovation journey is blocked and shape a practical 30/60/90 plan. Whether you need a [workshop](/services/custom-workshops), an incubation or acceleration path, structured [coaching or mentoring](/services/coaching-mentoring), or C‑level/board guidance, **ClarityScan® is where our shared work begins**.

### Who it’s for

- Startups clarifying target customer, problem-solution fit, and immediate risks.
- Public institutions aligning stakeholders and governance for visible progress.
- Established companies reducing decision latency across strategy and delivery.
- Incubators/accelerators upgrading cohort scaffolds and evidence-first methods.

## Why decision latency matters

- Latency = time from “we need a decision” to “we made one and acted.”
- High latency shows up as stalled OKRs, rework, and inconsistent delivery.
- The fix is rarely a single tool; it’s clarifying goals, owners, and evidence—then installing a cadence that sticks.

## How it works (15–20 minutes)

1) Context: goal, constraints, and where decisions stall today.
2) Quick maturity pass across MCF/IMM: strategy, culture, evidence, cadence, governance.
3) Signals: where proof is thin vs. strong; risks you can address fast.
4) Decisions & owners: who needs to decide what, and by when.
5) 30/60/90: a short plan that reduces latency and builds momentum.

## Problem → Objective → Solution alternatives

- Problem: Decision latency and low clarity slow outcomes—teams struggle to define target customers precisely, articulate the core problem, and agree on evidence to proceed.
- Objective: Reduce time-to-decision with a shared baseline, explicit owners, and near-term tests that build confidence and momentum.
- Solution alternatives:
  - A) Start directly with a multi-week program like [IMM‑P®](/services/innovation-maturity): strong for operating model change; slower to first decision improvement.
  - B) Run a one-day [custom workshop](/services/custom-workshops): great for alignment; needs a fast prior baseline for sharper outcomes.
  - C) Begin with **ClarityScan®**: fastest path to surface constraints/risks, assign owners, and create a 30/60/90 plan; pairs well with A or B.

## What you get

- A one‑page maturity snapshot with priority gaps.
- A **shortlist of risks** and how to test them.
- A **30/60/90** plan with clear owners and next steps.
- Fit guidance: when to continue with a **half‑day workshop** vs. move into **IMM‑P® (12+12 weeks)**.

## Where it fits

- Start with **[ClarityScan®](/services/clarityscan)** for baseline and priority, or **[book online](/book-clarityscan)**.
- Use a **[half‑day workshop](/services/custom-workshops)** to align stakeholders and turn the plan into action.
- Move into **[IMM‑P®](/services/innovation-maturity)** to install operating rhythms, governance, and instrumentation.
