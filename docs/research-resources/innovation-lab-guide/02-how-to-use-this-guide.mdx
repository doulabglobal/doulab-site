## How to Use This Guide (and What "Success" Looks Like)

:::tip[Definitions]
**Portfolio governance**: The decision rights, cadence, and criteria used to allocate resources across innovation bets.
**Decision gate**: A formal Go / Review / No-Go checkpoint based on minimum evidence thresholds.
:::

### Who this is for

- **Public-sector leaders:** Translate mission priorities into evidence-backed portfolios and delivery outcomes.
- **Innovation lab directors:** Establish governance, cadence, and decision gates that sustain throughput.
- **Policy and strategy owners:** Align lab work with national or institutional priorities and measurable outcomes.
- **Delivery teams:** Operate within a repeatable loop that converts discovery into validated pilots.

### What you can do in 30 days, 90 days, and 12 months

- **30 days:** Publish a lab charter, define intake criteria, and baseline three operating metrics.
- **90 days:** Complete two discovery cycles, one validation gate, and one evidence review memo.
- **12 months:** Run quarterly portfolio reviews, scale three pilots, and document impact metrics by category.

### What “good” looks like (minimum viable lab vs. mature lab)

- **Minimum viable lab:** Clear charter, a single decision gate, and a small portfolio with defined outcomes.
- **Mature lab:** Portfolio governance, repeatable evidence standards, and cross-institution delivery agreements.
- **Minimum viable evidence:** A written hypothesis, one experiment, and a decision memo.
- **Mature evidence:** Comparable baselines, longitudinal outcomes, and public transparency when appropriate.
- **Decision cadence:** Monthly operating reviews at minimum; quarterly portfolio decisions at maturity.

### How MCF 2.2, IMM, VILF, and Vigía Futura fit together

- **MCF 2.2:** Defines the operating loop and evidence requirements for each phase of innovation.
- **IMM:** Aligns lab ambition to maturity, resource levels, and governance readiness.
- **VILF:** [*Vigía Innovation Lab Framework (VILF)*](https://vilf.doulab.net) establishes network design and governance for multi-lab coordination at scale.
- **Vigía Futura:** Can provide foresight inputs that shape portfolio choices and capability bets.
- **Integration:** The four elements connect evidence, maturity, governance, and foresight into a single system.
