## The Core Logic (One Page)

Innovation labs exist because complex problems require disciplined experimentation under uncertainty. Without a structured operating system, innovation effort drifts, evidence stays weak, and delivery timelines become unstable. The guide organizes innovation work so that investment decisions remain credible over time.

Operationally, this shows up as explicit decision gates, evidence criteria, and portfolio review cadence.

**If-Then chain**

- If uncertainty rises, then discovery and validation should be disciplined and time-bound.
- If discovery is disciplined, then the lab can operate as a reliable operating system.
- If the lab is an operating system, then portfolio governance can allocate resources transparently.
- If portfolio governance is clear, then maturity can be managed rather than assumed.
- If maturity is managed, then network scaling can be intentional and resilient.
- If networks are resilient, then national outcomes compound through shared evidence.

**Definitions**

- **Innovation Lab:** A governed operating unit that converts hypotheses into evidence and delivery decisions.
- **Portfolio:** A managed set of innovation bets with shared criteria, cadence, and resource allocation.
- **Maturity:** The capability level that determines how much complexity a lab can sustain.
- **Network:** A coordinated system of labs sharing standards, governance, and learning loops.
- **Foresight:** A structured capability that supplies signals, scenarios, and strategic options.

**Decision implication:** Governance and reuse mechanisms should be treated as design variables, not afterthoughts.
