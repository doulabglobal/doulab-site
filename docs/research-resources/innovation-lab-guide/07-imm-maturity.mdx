## Innovation Labs and Maturity: The Role of the Innovation Maturity Model (IMM)

The Innovation Maturity Model (IMM) is a capability progression model used to help explain why innovation labs stall, fragment, or scale. It frames how institutional readiness shapes the outcomes labs can realistically deliver over time.

In practice, this means maturity assessments should influence resourcing, governance load, and portfolio scope.

#### IMM Snapshot (Example)

| IMM Pillar | Early-stage signals | Mature signals | Metric | Typical intervention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Governance clarity | Roles and decision rights unclear | Decision rights documented and enforced | Decision turnaround time | Update decision matrix |
| Evidence discipline | Ad hoc experiments | Standardized experiment templates | Hypothesis validation rate | Evidence templates and review |
| Portfolio logic | Opportunistic intake | Prioritized portfolio tiers | Portfolio balance ratio | Intake rubric and cadence |
| Capability reuse | One-off tooling | Reusable toolkits and playbooks | Reuse rate | Shared methods library |
| Talent readiness | Skill gaps by role | Cross-functional skill coverage | Role coverage index | Training and staffing plan |
| Delivery alignment | Weak handoffs | Formal delivery agreements | Adoption rate | Joint delivery governance |

Maturity-based resourcing rule: staffing, tooling, and governance should scale with demonstrated maturity rather than ambition. Use evidence thresholds and decision-cycle metrics to prevent premature scaling, such as decision turnaround time and hypothesis validation rate.

Labs are often more effective when designed for their maturity level rather than an aspirational end state. Tooling without maturity alignment can increase risk by creating process debt and fragile operating expectations.

**Decision implication:** Maturity assessment should determine governance load and resourcing before expanding portfolio scope.
