## A blueprint for next generation decentralized governance

### Executive summary

This paper outlines a staged blueprint for a **federated, agent-based AI infrastructure** that balances **sovereignty, privacy, and accountability**. It combines open identity standards, verifiable credentials, zero trust networking, auditable agent registries, and programmable workflows. The goal is **credible autonomy with human oversight**, suitable for government and enterprise. The design aligns with **W3C DID/VC**, **NIST AI RMF**, **ISO 42001**, and **Zero Trust** guidance, while anticipating obligations under the **EU AI Act**.

---

### 1) Why a new model

Digital infrastructure scaled faster than our capacity to **govern** it. Centralized platforms raise concerns about power concentration, data transfer, and lock-in. AI systems increase the stakes, since errors and bias can propagate at scale. A **federated, agentic** approach lets institutions keep control, share protocols, and coordinate through open, auditable interfaces.

**Design aim:** shift from platform dependence to **sovereign, standards-based interoperation** with clear lines of accountability.

---

### 2) Architecture at a glance

A network of **autonomous nodes** (ministries, agencies, state-owned enterprises, municipalities, firms) share common protocols but **keep data and policy local**. Each node runs small, task-specific **agents** with signed capabilities and observable behavior.

**Key components**

- **Identity and trust:** DID registries, verifiable credentials, X.509 for infrastructure. Keys held in HSM or cloud KMS.
- **Agent layer:** small models, tools, and adapters with explicit scopes, signed manifests, and runbooks.
- **Messaging:** encrypted bus for interop, queue or MLS style group encryption.
- **Workflows:** BPM rules that bind decisions to evidence packs and gate reviews.
- **Data plane:** Zero Trust, policy enforcement, confidential compute when needed.
- **Payments rail:** retail or wholesale rails, including CBDC pilots, instant payments, tokenized deposits.
- **Oversight:** human review, incident response, red team, and public logs when appropriate.

### 3) Design principles

Keep it simple, composable, and auditable. Favor small, testable parts over monoliths.

:::

**What this prevents:** vendor lock-in, opaque decisions, one-size-fits-all models, unsafe data gravity.

---

### 4) Reference modules

**Identity and Access.** DIDs and Verifiable Credentials for people, organizations, and agents. Use FIDO/WebAuthn for phishing‑resistant authentication. Map assurance to NIST 800-63 levels.

**PKI & Trust.** X.509 for infrastructure, threshold signatures for quorum-based control, signed agent manifests.

**Agent Runtime.** Policy sandbox, capability tokens, tool allowlists, reproducible prompts, and dataset cards.

**Messaging & Interop.** Message schemas for evidence, decisions, and events. Support confidential channels between nodes.

**Workflow/BPM.** Stage gates, roles, escalation, and immutable evidence logs.

**Ledger or Log.** Append-only audit with retention, privacy budget, and access logs.

**Payments.** CBDC pilot, instant payments, or tokenized deposits, with clear compliance rails.

**Observability.** Model cards, evaluation traces, drift monitors, data lineage, and kill switches.

#### How modules interact

- Identity issues and verifies credentials used by the Agent Runtime and Workflow gates.
- Agent Runtime signs actions and emits events to Messaging; Messaging forwards to other nodes.
- Workflow consumes events and writes Evidence Packs to the Audit Log.
- Secure Data Plane enforces access decisions from Workflow and Policy.
- Payments are optional but can be triggered by Workflow once gates pass.
- Human Oversight can approve, deny, or request more evidence at defined gates.

### 6) Implementation pathway

Start small, prove value, then scale with confidence.

:::info Program stages
```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'fontSize': 16}}%%
flowchart LR
  S1["Stage 1: Minimal Federation\n3-5 nodes, DID + VC + Agent Registry,\nEncrypted messaging, Evidence pack schema"]
    --> S2["Stage 2: Modular Expansion\nBPM, storage vaults, payments rail,\npolicy sandbox, red team drills"]
    --> S3["Stage 3: Federation at Scale\nMulti-tenant agents, cross-domain workflows,\nsovereignty guardrails, public dashboards"]
```
:::

**Stage 1**

- Stand up DID/VC, issue roles, configure WebAuthn, define evidence pack schema, register the first agents.
- Pilot one or two cross‑org workflows, for example permits or case referrals.

**Stage 2**

- Add BPM, vaults, and a payments rail.
- Run privacy reviews, security tests, and red team exercises.
- Publish model and dataset cards, define deprecation and rollback.

**Stage 3**

- Expand to more nodes with shared catalogs, conformance tests, and continuous controls.
- Publish dashboards on service levels, appeals, and incidents that the public can read when appropriate.

  B --> G8[Human review at gates, red teaming]
  A["Accountability gaps"] --> G9[Evidence packs, immutable logs]
  A --> G10[Incident playbooks, public readouts]
```
:::

**Operational practices**

- **Assurance by design:** map controls to NIST AI RMF functions (govern, map, measure, manage).
- **Management system:** adopt ISO 42001 to embed AI governance in day‑to‑day operations.
- **Zero Trust posture:** continuous verification, least privilege, and segmentation by default.
- **Legal readiness:** classify systems under EU AI Act risk tiers, keep technical documentation and post‑market monitoring.
- **Public trust:** enable contestation, publish summaries, and run feedback loops.

---

### 8) Policy alignment and norms

- **Identity and credentials:** W3C DID Core and VC Data Model 2.0 support portable trust. They reduce vendor lock‑in and simplify cross‑border checks.
- **Digital identity assurance:** NIST SP 800‑63 aligns identity proofing and authentication with risk.
- **Security:** NIST SP 800‑207 defines Zero Trust. Pair with WebAuthn and threshold signatures for quorum control.
- **Management systems:** ISO 42001 provides an auditable AI management framework.
- **Regulation:** the EU AI Act introduces obligations for high‑risk AI, documentation, quality management, and incident reporting.
- **Monetary rails:** CBDC pilots and tokenized deposits continue to mature. Treat them as optional modules with strict compliance.

### 9) Program blueprint with MCF 2.1 and IMM‑P

This is not only a technical architecture. It is a delivery program that uses **MicroCanvas Framework (MCF) 2.1** and the **Innovation Maturity Model Program (IMM‑P)** to reduce risk and build capability.

**Gates and cadence**

- **Gate 0: Alignment.** MCF canvases capture goals, users, risks, and success signals. Output: scope, owners, guardrails.
- **Gate 1: Discovery.** Evidence shows user needs, constraints, and early segments. Output: decision memo, top risks, experiment plan.
- **Gate 2: Validation.** Controlled pilots, security and privacy reviews, and operating runbooks. Output: gate review and go/no‑go.
- **Gate 3: Efficiency.** BPM and observability in place, conformance checks passed. Output: service SLOs, playbooks.
- **Gate 4: Scale.** Multi‑node federation, public dashboards where applicable. Output: adoption and risk metrics.

**RACI**

- **Sponsor (R).** Budget and policy guardrails.
- **Program lead (A).** Outcomes and cadence.
- **Security & privacy (C).** Reviews and exceptions.
- **Delivery teams (R).** Agents, workflows, integrations.
- **Oversight board (I/C).** Gate reviews and appeals.

**Gate criteria**

- Evidence pack completeness, risk log, model and dataset cards, red team results, user consent and appeal flow, and privacy budget where applicable.

**Conformance starter checklist**

- DID/VC conformance, MFA/WebAuthn for admins, encrypted messaging, audit log retention, incident response, and roll‑back tested.

### 10) Open challenges

- **Interpretable autonomy:** how much behavior to encode in policy versus learned models.
- **Cross‑border data:** reconcile residency rules with federated analytics.
- **Procurement and lock‑in:** write open standards and exit clauses into contracts.
- **Capability gaps:** train teams and publish playbooks to avoid vendor dependency.

---

### 11) Conclusion

We do not automate institutions. We equip them. A federated and agentic design lets leaders adopt AI while keeping control, transparency, and legitimacy. Start with a small federation, prove value in weeks, then grow with confidence.
