## 2025-09-28 - v0.7.3

### Highlights
- Federated AI whitepaper rebuilt for rigor and stability: IMM-P © standardized, copyright symbol fixed, MDX parsing errors resolved, and academic scaffolding added (research questions, methodology, pilots, comparative analysis, threats/limitations, ethics/compliance, TCO, repeatability, risks/mitigations, UX checklist, minimum evidence, glossary, style snapshot).
- Innovation Readiness Workshop page now links to core services/docs and uses the live bookings CTA.

### UX & CTAs
- Wired the hero “Book a discovery call” CTA on the Innovation Readiness Workshop page to the configured bookings URL (mirrors the final CTA).
- Added a related-links section on the workshop page pointing to ClarityScan, IMM-P program, Custom Workshops, and the distributed federated AI whitepaper.

### Content & Docs
- Standardized IMM-P © usage across the whitepaper and updated front matter to fix MDX build breaks.
- Restored whitepaper content from backup and ensured comparison operators are escaped to satisfy MDX.

### Known follow-ups
- Replace the placeholder BOOKINGS_URL with the final Microsoft Bookings link once available.

## 2025-09-24 - v0.7.2

### Highlights
- New blog post: "Vigía Futura: Why Latin America Needs a Strategic Foresight Observatory"
- Stripe Checkout now powers ClarityScan® purchases with a single CTA source of truth.
- Added a post-payment success page that immediately surfaces the Microsoft Bookings link.

### UX & CTAs
- Repointed every “Book a ClarityScan® online” CTA to the Stripe checkout (home, services, case studies, contact, What We Do, Work With Us, Vigía Futura, etc.).
- Introduced a page, auto-opening the Microsoft Bookings page and keeping a fallback CTA on-screen.
- Standardized booking copy to “ClarityScan®” across the flow.

### Content & Taxonomy
- Added `foresight` and `latin-america` blog tags for upcoming signal and regional coverage.

### DX & Maintenance
- Introduced `src/constants/urls.ts` so ClarityScan® booking and checkout URLs live in one reusable place.

## 2025-09-13 - v0.7.1

### Highlights
- Blog cards reliability: fixed homepage and Insights "Latest from the blog" cards linking to a non-prefixed path (404 risk). Links are now normalized to always live under `/blog`.
- New post: “ClarityScan®: how a 30-45 minute baseline reduces decision latency”.

### UX & CTAs
- Added/standardized direct “Book a ClarityScan® online” CTAs across the site, pointing to Outlook Bookings.
  - Home: hero secondary CTA + final CTA (`src/pages/index.tsx`).
  - Insights: final CTA (`src/pages/insights/index.tsx`).
  - About: final CTA (`src/pages/about/index.tsx`).
  - Contact: final CTA (`src/pages/contact/index.tsx`).
  - Case studies: final CTA on AFP Siembra, Alpha Inversiones, FUNDAPEC, OGTIC/RedLab, and index (`src/pages/case-studies/*`).
  - Vigía Futura: final CTA (`src/pages/vigia-futura/index.tsx`).
  - Services: ClarityScan page final CTA (`src/pages/services/clarityscan.tsx`).
- Service-specific booking links where relevant:
  - Custom Workshops: added a half-day booking link in-page and final CTA (`src/pages/services/custom-workshops.tsx`).
  - Coaching & Mentoring, Innovation Maturity: final CTAs include “Book a ClarityScan® online” as the on-ramp (`src/pages/services/coaching-mentoring.tsx`, `src/pages/services/innovation-maturity.tsx`).
- Added canonical booking redirect page: `/book-clarityscan` (`src/pages/book-clarityscan.tsx`).

### Technical changes
- Homepage RSS parser update to normalize same-origin links to `/blog`.
  - `src/pages/index.tsx:391` (`useLatestBlogPosts`) ensures same-origin links that don’t start with `/blog` are prefixed.
- Insights page RSS/Atom parser updated with the same normalization.
  - `src/pages/insights/index.tsx:25` (`sameOriginToRelative`) prefixes same-origin links with `/blog`.
- Removed temporary static redirects (not needed after normalization).

### QA notes
- Verified dev build resolves latest post cards to `/blog/<slug>`.
- External links and dated blog URLs remain unchanged.

### Known follow-ups
- Blog tag permalinks look duplicated (e.g., `/blog/tags/blog/tags/...`) in dev metadata; investigate taxonomy config and plugin output.
