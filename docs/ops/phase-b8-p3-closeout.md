# Phase B8-P3 Closeout (N/A)

## Decision
B8-P3 is closed as N/A (already satisfied).

## Reason
The two target case study pages already contain exactly two Mermaid diagrams each, using the B8-P1 grammar and required admonition wrapper. No remaining executable scope exists without introducing no-op changes.

## Evidence
- `src/pages/case-studies/afp-siembra.tsx`
- `src/pages/case-studies/fundapec.tsx`

## Covered by B8-P2 commits
- Feature commit: 309fbb3aa4d32a3184f64b10bd2284d29d255b98
- Mapping commit: 7c56d5a5f3d9d8f696f6e6d6a1c7c1372b4a6e5e
